Vector Computing in AVX-512

Some of modern CPUs have vector machines which could potentially improve total throughput of some applications. As SIMD machines, vector processors have potential to accelerate programs when the algorithms could be partially/fully vectorized.

This repository aims to explain the concepts in vector computing using AVX-512 intrinsics in C++. Every .cc file is meant to address yet another concept in vectorization.
